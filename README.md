# PINKRED 
###### My first game in godot engine 

<br>

Hello! 

This is short 2D platform game about a girl (Pink) which suffers from anemia.

When the body is deficient in iron, red cells do not develop as they should. You can help Pink catch betroots to get healthy again!

I created this project to learn new game engine - Godot, as well as its programming language - gdscript. 
Developing this game let me explore TileMap, animations, UI, signals, saving data and other tools in Godot. 
I love taking care of details and aesthetics in my projects.
